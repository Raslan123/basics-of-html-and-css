<p>Sukumara Kurup (alias Sukumara Pillai) (born as P K Gopalakrishna Kurup) is an Indian fugitive and is one of the most-wanted criminals in the Indian state of Kerala.
On January 21, 1984, he, along with his co-brother Bhaskara Pillai, his driver Ponnappan and his aide Shahu, murdered a man named Chacko
in an attempt to fake Kurup's own death and thereby claim a life insurance amount of â‚¹8 lakh (US$10,000).
The subterfuge was soon exposed by the police, who arrested Bhaskara Pillai, Ponnappan and Shahu.
However, Kurup absconded from the state in the meantime.Notorious for being India's longest wanted fugitive, Kurup is still missing and untraced since 1984</p>
